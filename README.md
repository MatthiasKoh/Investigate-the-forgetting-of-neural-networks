# Continual Learning with CIFAR10 and in house AnimalParts Dataset
### Edited by Matthias Koh

This is a PyTorch implementation of the continual learning experiments that closely follows https://github.com/GMvandeVen/continual-learning 
and takes reference to experients described in the following papers:
* Three scenarios for continual learning ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07734))
* Generative replay with feedback connections as a general strategy 
for continual learning ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10635))
